# Archived Test Files

This directory contains **old JavaScript test files** that have been replaced by newer TypeScript comprehensive test files.

## Files in this directory:

1. **calculator.test.js** → Replaced by `calculator-comprehensive.test.ts`
2. **data-validation.test.js** → Replaced by `data-validation-comprehensive.test.ts`
3. **events.test.js** → Replaced by `events-comprehensive.test.ts`
4. **modal.test.js** → Replaced by `modal-comprehensive.test.ts`
5. **synergy.test.js** → Replaced by `synergy-comprehensive.test.ts`
6. **utils.test.js** → Replaced by `utils-comprehensive.test.ts`

## Why archived?

These files were kept for historical reference but are no longer run in CI. The TypeScript replacements provide:
- Better type safety
- More comprehensive test coverage
- Edge case testing
- Modern test patterns

## Can they be deleted?

Yes, after verifying the comprehensive versions have equivalent or better coverage. These are kept temporarily for reference during the transition period.
