It starts normally at 10 extra level to your weapons, and gives one less level per stack.

This is a nice buff that makes stacking the item more valuable than previouslyBalancing (Credit Cards)Let's talk about credit card meta changes. One big issue right now is that the gold multiplier stat is completely useless because you just need a [[item:kevin|Kevin]] and a [[item:golden_shield|Golden Shield]] and you never have to worry about money again. Then you spam chests and banish all purples to stack tons of credit cards. Lots of people dislike this meta, and I also think it really devalues [[character:robinette|Robinette]]'s passive, Gold Tome and the Gold Multiplier stat in general. So here are some changes to address this:Green Credit Card -> Each card increases chest prices by 10%. This change should still keep it fun in casual play, but hopefully not make it mandatory for leaderboard runs anymore, as chests will be very expensive if you keep stacking credit cards. It also makes canonical sense since it's a credit card lolKevin -> Moved up one tier in rarity (Purple / Epic) because of how strong and how much utility this item hasGolden Shield -> Now gives more gold upon taking damage, however if the damage is from [[item:kevin|Kevin]] or [[item:leeching_crystal|Leeching Crystal]], the gold is reduced. Hopefully this gives Gold Multiplier stat some value againClover - Gives more luck 7.5% -> 10%[[tome:luck|Luck Tome]] - Gives more luck 7% -> 8%This will probably be adjusted more in the future when we see how this impacts stuff. Some other suggestions I've heard for the green credit cards is to give it diminishing returns per card, which is also an interesting idea. But let's see how this plays out for now, and then I'll adjust accordingly in future patches.OtherUpdated the Press Kit on Itch for any content creators who want the new item icons or whateverBuh's passive \"Bullseye\" now shows as its own damage source at the end screen, instead of showing as Sniper damageAlright imma go celebrate christmas now im late to the dinner uh oh cya"

No more sunglasses needed for late-game.\nSystem Support for running the game in DX12. DX11 is recommended, but if you are experiencing crashes, running in DX12 *might* help. There should be a Steam popup that shows when you boot the game, allowing you to choose. If it's not showing yet, try restarting Steam. Also keep in mind, if you run your game in DX12, certain graphical features will be broken, like Ambient Occlusion and Color Grading.\n Game Particles and effects opacity slider added in Visuals settings. Auto opacity is enabled by default, and should be enough for most players. Do keep in mind that a lot of transparent projectiles is a bit harder for your PC to render, but that doesn't really matter until you have a fuckton of projectiles in late game. When you do have a fuckton of projectiles with ridiculous size covering the entire screen, you might wanna make them fully transparent, or set them to 0 transparency for absolute best FPS. But you can just experiment with this.\n [[tome:silver|Silver Tome]] can now be toggled\n Charge shrines are now a different color on the minimap than other shrines\n Fixed an issue with [[weapon:hero_sword|Hero [[weapon:sword|Sword]]]] and [[weapon:corrupted_sword|Corrupted [[weapon:sword|Sword]]]], where if you got a lot of size, the speed of the [[weapon:sword|Sword]] projectile didn't scale with the size.\n Money particles move faster now during final swarm, so that you can still pick them up while running\n Balancing [[character:fox|Fox]] passive buff: 1% -> 2% Luck per level\n [[character:birdo|Birdo]] Passive: [[character:birdo|Birdo]] now gains 1% Airborne Damage per level\n [[character:bush|Bush]] Passive: 0.5% -> 1% Crit Damage per level. Bullseyes appear more often on enemies, and the explosion size now scales with size mutliplier.\n [[character:megachad|Megachad]] Passive - Gain 2.5% damage every time you flex\n [[character:noelle|Noelle]] now gains Size instead of Duration per level. She also gains a damage multiplier per frozen enemy (0.02x per frozen enemy, so 50 frozen = 2x damage)\n [[character:robinette|Robinette]] Passive: Buffed early and mid game, but starts to gain less damage per gold after 200k gold. This only really affects super late-game leaderboard runs, and I'm making this change so we can see other characters on the leaderboards. It would be nice to buff all other characters to become as strong as [[character:robinette|Robinette]], but that is not something I can do overnight, so a short term solution was to just nerf her passive late-game for now. I'd like to eventually get in per-character leaderboards too, which also kinda solves this problem.\n [[character:dicehead|Dicehead]] Passive: Buffed a bit, the rewards don't fall off as fast anymore. Previously his rewards were halved by level 25, now they are halved by level 50.\n [[character:calcium|Calcium]] Passive: Buffed and simplified a bit. Now gains 0.75% damage per level and 0.5% per 1% Speed Multiplier. This damage is applied gradually as [[character:calcium|Calcium]] approaches his top speed.\n [[character:ogre|Ogre]] Passive - Buffed 1% -> 1.5%\n [[item:scarf|Scarf]] does more damage now 33% -> 50%\n [[item:brass_knuckles|Brass Knuckles]]: Changed from Additive to Flat, which makes scaling stronger, and now increases size per amount stacked\n [[character:spaceman|Spaceman]] no longer takes fall damage\n [[item:cursed_doll|Cursed Doll]] can now curse more than 1 enemy (1 -> 5) every time it ticks (every 1s).  \nOther [[character:calcium|Calcium]]'s Theme is now extended and goes twice as hard\n Leaderboard reset time is scheduled 4 hours earlier every Sunday, just so I don't have to stay up until 2am to verify everything is working right\n I've signed up for Nvidia Geforce Now / Steam Cloud Play. I'm not sure how long it takes to get approved, but it should be available there soon!\n If gaining multiple levels instantly, you can now see the stats change on the right hand side as you pick upgrades. Previously the stats only updated after you completed all your level up offers.\nBugs Fixed a bug where Shady Guy doesn't disappear after purchasing from him\n Fixed a bug where HP gained from leveling didn't show in the stats screen. Also it didn't work with stuff like [[item:beefy_ring|Beefy Ring]]. (You gain +1 Max HP per level on all characters.\n Fixed a bug where [[item:campfire|Campfire]] didn't go away after microwaving it\n If you're standing next to a chest, and get enough money to buy it, the text will now change from red to white without having to move away from the chest and back into range\n Fixed an issue where Shattered Wisdom didn't deal any damage. It now works as intended (and might be very strong idk)\n Fixed a bug where items could damage enemies when game was paused\n (Hopefully) Fixed a bug where the music stops playing at the intro of a game\n Fixed a bug where banishing every Epic item would no longer grant any Legendary items\n Fixed a bug where [[tome:chaos|Chaos Tome]] reward was multiplied by Luck Multiplier twice. Basically legendary upgrades grew exponentially.\n Tried to fix an issue where some players couldn't play the game at all because the menu was bugged.\n okYep that's it for now. thanks for playing and for all the feedback. i realize there's still a lot of balancing changes that people wanna see, but keep in mind im just a single person working on this, so I can only do so much every week. Next week I might try to do some new content for Halloween, if I can cook something up in time. \n\npeace"

      "raw_notes": "Version 1.0.12 Patch Notes Yo sorry about the leaderboards being broken the last few days, i took some time off over the weekend, and of course some mfers decided to break the leaderboard for everyone. But technically it's my fault for not securing the leaderboards enough, i just never expected this many people to play fucking Megabonk lol. Anyway should be fixed now! TLDRLeaderboards are fixed (i hope Shroud enjoyed his 2 day vacation)Final swarms now has some new stuff to prevent 5 hour long runs(Hopefully) fixed a bug where Alt-F4 or crashes corrupted save files   Changelog Final SwarmThe current meta required you to wear sunglasses and watch a slideshow / lightshow at 1.5fps for 5 hours to get a WR. This was never intended, and I don't think anyone actually enjoyed that, so I've stirred up some shit. The final swarm is harder to survive, and your executes and black holes won't really save you anymore... probablyNew ghosts appear in the Final Swarm  GameAdded [[character:megachad|Megachad]]'s ThemeOptimized FPS when using [[weapon:dexecutioner|Dexecutioner]] and [[weapon:black_hole|Black Hole]]  OtherHopefully fixed an issue where players lost their save files if the game crashed BugsSpaceman's passive now properly works and gives XP increase per levelFixed a bug where the [[weapon:black_hole|Black Hole]] hitboxes were like 10x the size of the actual projectile, basically covering the entire map lolFixed a bug where [[item:spiky_shield|Spiky Shield]] didn't stack correctly Added max duration to weapons, so that they don't stop shooting once you hit the projectile limit. For example the [[weapon:sword|Sword]] projectile was being affected by duration, even though it's only ever active for 1 seconds. But too much duration made it active for much longer, which means the cap was being filled with empty projectiles. Basically: Weapons like [[weapon:dexecutioner|Dexecutioner]], [[weapon:axe|Axe]], [[weapon:sword|Sword]], etc are working properly and shooting their projectiles now, even with high duration. This is a buff for pretty much all weapons.  BalancingChaos Tome now gives 50% better rewardsRolly Bones enemies on Desert are now slowerBlack Hole default size increased by 20%[[weapon:black_hole|Black Hole]] proc coefficient reduced (0.9 -> 0.7) to match similar weapons ([[weapon:sword|Sword]], [[weapon:axe|Axe]], [[weapon:aura|Aura]], etc). Proc Coefficient is a multiplier used to proc stuff like [[item:moldy_cheese|Moldy Cheese]] or [[item:spicy_meatball|Spicy Meatball]].[[character:bush|Bush]]'s passive Marksman now has its cooldown reduced by 0.4s per 10 levels. Starts at 5s cooldown, and caps at 1s cooldown at level 100.[[item:joes_dagger|Joe's Dagger]] now has a max damage increase cap of 200 per minute. So if you have 10 daggers, that's a max of 2000% damage per minute. This means it's unchanged early and mid game, but very late game it's not gonna be the only viable option anymore. Before this change, you could get 20 000% damage in 10 seconds, which nothing else in the game could contest lolXP Tome nerf: 9% -> 7% . The majority wanted this nerf, but some people really don't like it. At least give it a try, and If everyone ends up hating it, I can just revert it back to 9% next week. please go easy on me  LeaderboardsFixed some issues that allowed players to break the leaderboards for othersRemoved the All Leaderboards button until I actually implement more leaderboard stuff, like character specific boards, etcSet up a list of known cheaters that are banned globally and will never show up on the leaderboards again once caught. Cheaters you better watch your ass or im clapping your cheeks back to the shadow realm where you belong  Future UpdatesThere's a lot more stuff I'm working on that's coming soon probably:Opacity setting for particles and projectilesFull sized map with fog of war so you can see where you've beenMore information when hovering stuff, like weapon stats, etcPinning / Tracking quests in-game when paused -  And for more major stuff I wanna look at once most of the common feedback has been addressed:MultiplayerMore maps, items, characters and weaponsAnything else you would like to see? :)"
